This project focused on using observational data from Type Ia Supernovae (standard candles) to estimate two important cosmological parameters: the Hubble Constant (H0) and the Age of the Universe. Type Ia supernovae provide reliable measurements of distance across the Universe, and when combined with redshift data, they form the basis of the Hubble diagram — a key observational tool for studying cosmic expansion.
By modeling the relationship between redshift and distance modulus, and fitting this to real data using the ΛCDM cosmological model, we were able to derive H0 and explore how it changes with different redshift samples and assumptions about the matter density of the Universe (Ωₘ).
